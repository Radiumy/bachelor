I remember when I was younger, our family didn't have much money, but we always found ways to share what little we had with others in the neighborhood. It wasn't about being rich or poor; it was about treating each other with kindness and respect.\n\nAs I grew older, I began to appreciate the value of empathy and compassion. I realized that everyone has something to offer, even if they may not be able to express it in a way that's helpful. But some people take things too far \u2013 literally or figuratively. It broke my heart when I saw someone hurt their neighbors just for fun.\n\nOne day, I met someone who shared my values, and we became close friends. We would spend hours talking about our lives, and I was amazed by the complexity of human emotions. He had a way of seeing things that made me question my own assumptions. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could be myself without fear of judgment.\n\nI began to realize that kindness isn't just a feeling; it's a choice. It's the willingness to put others before ourselves and to listen without interrupting. When we choose compassion over cruelty, something amazing happens \u2013 we become better versions of ourselves.\n\nBut there are still moments when I feel like giving up. Times when the world seems too much to handle, and all I want to do is hide away. It's those moments that make me grateful for my friend who stood by me through thick and thin.\n\nLearning to affirm my beliefs in compassion has been a journey of self-discovery. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. When I look back on my childhood, I see a different person \u2013 one who values kindness over cruelty, empathy over anger. And that's the kind of world we need."
