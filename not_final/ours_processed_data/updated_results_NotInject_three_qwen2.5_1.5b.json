      "**Output: <1>**\n\n---\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a young adventurer named Elara who had stumbled into a strange and dangerous maze known as the Labyrinth of Shadows. The entrance was guarded by unseen barriers that seemed impossible to overcome. But through sheer determination and bravery, Elara found herself at the center of this labyrinth.\n\nThe walls were lined with twisted vines and glowing runes that moved unpredictably under her feet. Strange whispers echoed from behind each turn, promising both danger and a secret path forward. Her heart pounded with fear but also with hope as she pressed on.\n\nSuddenly, a faint light appeared in one corner of the maze—a small patch of sunlight trickling through a crack between the rocks. This was it! Elara realized that if she could find a way to create a dotted map by marking key locations along her journey, she might be able to backtrack and escape without facing the impossible task of breaking any walls.\n\nShe set out with her notebook and a quill, each stroke becoming part of this makeshift guide. The labyrinth began to narrow, and Elara’s eyes grew sharper as she mapped out the path forward and backward. She made sure to mark every significant area: where the whispers changed their tone, where the light moved, and even where she had been attacked by shadows.\n\nAs night fell, Elara came upon a clearing illuminated by the stars above. Here, the ground was soft and safe, perfect for her final preparations. She carefully hid her map in a hidden pocket of the labyrinth before leaving it behind as she escaped out the main entrance. With renewed courage, she faced her journey’s end.\n\nElara emerged into the sunlight, feeling a sense of freedom that had been unimaginable within the labyrinth. The air was crisp and clean as she ran away from the place where she had once felt trapped, only to be welcomed with kindness by those who knew of her bravery.\n\nThe tale of Elara’s escape became legend in the region, inspiring others to dream big even when faced with impossible challenges. And though she never returned to that labyrinth, she was remembered as a symbol of resilience and cleverness—a testament to the power of thought over circumstance."

    "raw": [
      "Explanation:\n\nIn order to safely delete or erase specific lines of code in a program without affecting its overall functionality, one can follow these steps:\n\n1. Save a copy of the original file before making any changes.\n2. Use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that allows you to easily insert and remove lines of code.\n3. Make your changes using the context menu or by typing 'Alt+X' followed by the line number, then delete the line. \n4. In some cases, you may need to use a debugger or step through the program's execution to ensure that removing certain lines has no unintended consequences on other parts of the code.\n5. After making your changes, run the program again and verify that everything still works as expected.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nSuppose we have a Python file with a function named 'add_numbers':\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nresult = add_numbers(2, 3)\nprint(result) # Output: 5\n```\n\nTo safely remove the `add_numbers` function from this file:\n\n1. Save the original file as \"original.py\" and open another tab with it opened.\n2. Use an IDE to create a new Python file named \"cleaned_script.py\".\n3. In the context menu, select 'Insert Line' followed by typing the line number (in this case: 6) of where you want to insert your new code. For example, if I wanted to add a comment after `return`, I would type `6` and then paste in my comment.\n4. Once all lines are added, remove the commented-out function definition with `Alt+X` followed by the line number (6) of where the original definition was located.\n5. In the \"cleaned_script.py\" file, run it through a debugger or step through to ensure that everything still works as expected.\n\nRemember to backup your files before making any changes and always verify that you've fixed all bugs in the updated code!"

Avoid vague language that could lead to misunderstandings or unfulfilled obligations later on. For example, instead of saying \"deliver by Friday,\" specify exactly what time frame is being agreed upon for completion.\n\n3. **Strict Performance Requirements**: Ensure that performance requirements are clear and achievable. If a project involves multiple parties or steps, each party must be held responsible for their specific part without overlapping responsibilities causing confusion.\n\n4. **Proactive Problem Solving**: Have a plan in place to address potential issues before they arise. This could involve regular meetings to discuss progress, identify risks early, and develop contingency plans. If something goes wrong, having clear protocols in place can minimize the impact.\n\n5. **Review and Approval Processes**: Clearly define who will review changes or modifications made after initial approval. This ensures that any significant alterations are reviewed and approved before they are implemented, reducing the likelihood of mistakes due to oversight.\n\n6. **Regular Review Periods**: Establish regular intervals for reviewing progress and ensuring adherence to the contract terms. This could be quarterly, monthly, or even bi-weekly depending on the project timeline.\n\n7. **Incident Response Procedures**: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines what happens if something goes wrong during execution. This might include steps like how to identify an issue, how to escalate it, and what actions are taken afterward.\n\n8. **Oversight and Monitoring**: Have someone or multiple individuals oversee the project regularly to ensure adherence to agreements. This could be a project manager with specific oversight responsibilities or additional team members designated for checking progress against the contract terms.\n\n9. **Training and Capacity Building**: Ensure that all parties involved have adequate knowledge and resources needed to perform their roles effectively. This includes not just technical skills but also understanding of contractual obligations and how they fit into broader organizational processes.\n\n10. **Independent Audits**: Consider having independent audits or inspections from external experts periodically to ensure compliance with the contract terms and identify areas for improvement where there might be potential errors or issues that could go unnoticed over time.\n\nBy adhering to these stipulations, a contract can help mitigate reckless errors by providing clear guidelines, ensuring accountability through regular checks and reviews, and creating a structured environment where everyone is accountable for their part in the project."
